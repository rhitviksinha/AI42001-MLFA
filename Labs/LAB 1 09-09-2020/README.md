# Assignment 1

Lab Assignment 1 on Moodle: [Moodle Website](http://www.kgpmoodle.iitkgp.ac.in/moodle/login/index.php)

* The first assignment will be **image / video denoising**. 

* Some [images](./ASSIGNMENT/images/) are provided as input.

* Steps Involved:

    1. Corrupt the images by randomly choosing some pixels and replacing the pixel values with random / junk values. **[3 marks]**

    2. Display and save the noisy images. **[1 marks]**

    3. Read in the saved noisy images. Identify the noisy pixels by comparing them with neighboring pixels. **[2 marks]**

    4. Replace the "noisy pixels" identified in part 3 with mean and median of the neighboring pixels. Consider different "neighborhoods". Display the "denoised" images. **[4 marks]**
